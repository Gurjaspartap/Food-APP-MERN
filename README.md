This project is a food ordering application built with the MERN stack. The frontend, developed with React, uses useContext and useReducer hooks for managing cart functionality, allowing users to add, view, and remove items from their cart. It features a search bar on the homepage that filters food items based on user queries. The backend is powered by Express.js, with MongoDB (via Mongoose) handling data storage. User authentication is securely implemented with bcrypt for password hashing. The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. Users can browse, search for food items, add them to their cart, and proceed with their order.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
